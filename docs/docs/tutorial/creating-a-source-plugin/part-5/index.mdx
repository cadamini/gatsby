## Introduction

With the release of [Gatsby 3](/docs/reference/release-notes/v3.0/#incremental-builds-in-oss) Incremental Builds for everyone were introduced. Only a subset of HTML files will be regenerated for each change, making builds significantly faster. This works by tracking certain things like page templates, results of page and static queries, and frontend source code. This is a more generic approach and works with every site, regardless of which sources it uses. While the time it takes to generate the artifacts is decreased through that, often times a large portion of the build is spent on sourcing data from remote APIs through Gatsby source plugins.

And this is where you, the author of a source plugin, comes in!

- Why + How
- Explain that some parts of it are in the source plugin, some parts of it need to be supported by the remote API. So if they author the API themselves, they should add “Delta-Sync” abilities
- `touchNode`
- `deleteNode`, syncToken/delta-sync
- Using `cache` API to e.g. timestamp last sourcing
