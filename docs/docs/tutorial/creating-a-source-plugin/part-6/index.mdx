## Introduction

Gatsby always had best-in-class image support with its [`gatsby-plugin-image`](/plugins/gatsby-plugin-image/) feature. With it you can easily add responsive, optimized images to sites in all modern formats, and website visitors love how fast these images load, even on slow networks. Traditionally, images were downloaded and transformed during the Gatsby build to enable this behavior. Image CDN solves this by skipping image processing during the build, and instead deferring and offloading it to a dedicated image CDN. Visitors still get images in the most optimized formats such as AVIF and WebP, but site builds complete in a fraction of the time.

By the end of this part of the tutorial, you will be able to:

- Add Image CDN support to your source plugin
- Use Image CDN and `gatsby-plugin-image` in your example site

## TODO

- Why itâ€™s better than file downloading
- Local / Remote experience (as in: locally it processes files normally, remote it uses CDN)
- How-To piece
- Explain that remote API plays a big part here again. If not all data available, explain how to use https://github.com/nodeca/probe-image-size (short snippet)
